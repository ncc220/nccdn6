When looking at the licenses, I immediately gravitated to the shorter and easier to understand ones, like the two clause BSD license
(even the zero clause BSD) or the MIT license. I like to think that the idea of open source is to make the software easy to spread, 
so I don't want to put some extemely lengthy license on it, but I understand for specific software you would have to.

I also like some of the longer licenses that could summarize what they were about effectively, like how the artisic license begun 
with a preamble that explained what it did, and you could then read the lengthy text.
