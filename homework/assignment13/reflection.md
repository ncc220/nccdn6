This assignment was a bit of banging my head against a wall. When looking for what login service to use, I immediatly saw the open ID
connect and decided to use it, since I recongnized it from companies whose products I've used. Quite a selection process, to just choose
the first one I read, but oh well.

As for how much I got to work, I got nothing to work. I was able to track down all the libraries available to use with open id
https://openid.net/developers/libraries/  --> https://openid.net/developers/certified/

I decided to try and go with the c# library since another one of my classes currently has me working with visual studio and c#.
I figured that would be the easiest, I saw that there were java / js and other libraries that I could have potentially been familiar with,
but if I used something like javascript I figured doing something like making a website would only complicate this program further, and I
thought that using c# would jsut be easier.

What I instead found, was how little documentation open id has? At least for the c# library, I had no idea how to call it or anything. 
Just figuring out how to get github code into visual studio took me long enough and I'm not even sure I did it right anyway, since the
tutorials I found were for older versions.
