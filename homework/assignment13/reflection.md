This assignment was a bit of banging my head against a wall. When looking for what login service to use, I immediatly saw the open ID
connect and decided to use it, since I recongnized it from companies whose products I've used. Quite a selection process, to just choose
the first one I read, but oh well.

As for how much I got to work, I got nothing to work. I was able to track down all the libraries available to use with open id
https://openid.net/developers/libraries/  --> https://openid.net/developers/certified/

I decided to try and go with the c# library since another one of my classes currently has me working with visual studio and c#.
I figured that would be the easiest, I saw that there were java / js and other libraries that I could have potentially been familiar with,
but if I used something like javascript I figured doing something like making a website would only complicate this program further, and I
thought that using c# would jsut be easier.

What I instead found, was how little documentation open id has? At least for the c# library, I had no idea how to call it or anything. 
Just figuring out how to get github code into visual studio took me long enough and I'm not even sure I did it right anyway, since the
tutorials I found were for older versions. my next guess is that I need to mess with whatever nuget is.
It's funny because I beat my head against getting no progress over these extra days you've added to the assignment, only on the final day
to realize I could have just switched to another login service this entire time...

From now on, I'm working with software that has spectacular documentation and plenty of help online. Sorry to have not done much of
anything with this project.
