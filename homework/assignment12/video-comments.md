The takaway I have is that following the template is important. At first I didn't see why it was discussed for so long, 
but the more I thought about it the more sense it made. Making these metrics understandable to everyone in CHAOSS is one thing,
but these metrics should also be understandable to people outside of CHAOSS, so keeping them uniform could really help with that.
Similar to how you guys mentioned to try and keep the amount of words down in a metric. Since I was in the class town hall where my 
classmate showed you that metric you reviewed, I underestimated how hard it is to interpret a metric.

For the repository work I commited my value group metric
