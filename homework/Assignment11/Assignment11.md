I attended the general meeting on Tuesday the 7th at 11 AM.

I also listened to the podcast and it helps me appreciate all that goes into CHAOSS.
What I liked most about it was being able to learn more about each team member.
When I joined the meeting earlier today, I felt like I didn't understand who everyone was or what they did for the project,
But hearing everyone talk about their experience and how they wound up on the project was enlightening, to an extent.
I also have a clearer understanding of what the project is all about and what the team members each think of that respectively.
It was also fun hearing about the origin of CHAOSS, specifically how the acronym came about.
Listening to the podcast made me that little bit more enthusiastic about open source software.
