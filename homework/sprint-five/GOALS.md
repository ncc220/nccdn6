The purpose of this would be to further bolster my resume site to where I could have something better to show employers.
Currently it is rough around the edges as so many features of it are just requirements met to pass challenges in web development,
but with this I hope to add another feature to show potential employers in the future. 

I've seen resume sites that have a login so this seems like something plenty of people do. 
If I gate the entire site behind this, then I'll make the login a mickey mouse login or whatever you described earlier with a 
test login always working.

I won't collect any data, but the data that would be on display is data about me and my software developing skills.
The core audience is HR of some company I could be applying for, once I keep working on this site.
