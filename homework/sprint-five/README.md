I had to make a website for a web dev class. We also used an aws EC2 server. Part of the other class was making a resume site, 
I would like to add a login to this resume site to show that it works, either when you open a site or to access some app on the site.

Here is the public dns to access the website: ec2-18-224-135-187.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Currently it just has the resume site on it but I hope to get some kind of sso working with it.
The server is currently running a lampstack and I'm looking into other software ontop of that.
