I have no clue how to follow the in class tutorials posted with this so I just decided to do my own thing with the website.

One of the first tutorials I found was this one =
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-simplesamlphp-for-saml-authentication-on-ubuntu-16-04

It seemed promising, but in order to do that it wanted me to go back and do other tutorials, so it just seemed to get far too complicated
It also seemed to be just out of date enough to no longer be relevant? This may be my fault, but at least when I tried to use some
of the posted paths their stuff and mine looked completly different, so I gave up on it.

I've went back and am looking through the dex stuff you posted, that's the next potential solution I'm going to try.
